## Lecture 1

_INTELLIGENT AGENTS AND MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS: AN INTRODUCTION_

*   Motivation and basic definitions

*   Socio-technical systems

*   Example: vehicle agent

*   Agent-based modelling and simulation

*   Agent architectures
    *   Reactive
    *   Ant-based
    *   Practical reasoning
    *   Belief, Desire, Intention


---
## What is this about?

We aim at understanding, modelling, building complex, ”intelligent” autonomous systems
So what? – humans have been doing this for a long time …
*   James Watt – Steam Engine
*   Weather forecast
*   Traffic flows and traffic forecast
*   Energy network management
*   Finance markets …

But
*   Often unclear system boundaries
*   What if systems are not hierarchically, centrally organized?
*   Often simplifying assumptions regarding behaviour of system parts
*   Forecasting the weather doesn’t change it, forecasting traffic …?
*   Often, it doesn’t work properly


---
## Socio-technical systems (STS) <sup>Singh, 2014</sup>

Combine (information) technology with real-life societal considerations
System characteristics

*   Longevity and openness

*   Societal requirements, often characterized by norms

*   Indirect ”control” mechanisms (sanctions, incentives, markets, …)


---
## Socio-technical systems (STS) <sup>Singh, 2014</sup>

Member characteristics
*   Longevity and identity

*   Human or automated (humans not as users, but as part of a system)

*   Autonomy (goals, capabilities) and heterogeneity

Realization
*   Top-down: Members fit into existing systems
	*   Adopt suitable goals given system norms

*   Bottom up: Members design new systems
	*   Negotiate suitable norms given individual goals


---
## The ”3M” approach to modelling socio-technical systems

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_004.png#centering)


---
## Traffic/Smart City Systems are STS!

*   Longlived infrastructure

*   Self-interested, autonomous traffic participants

*   Highly heterogeneous

*   Societal issues: Efficiency, safety, comfort, environmental friendliness, fairness, sustainability

*   Decentral decisions vs. centralized (?) regulation

*   New technologies (automated driving, social networks, digitalization)
    *   influence behaviour of traffic participants
    *   enable new services, business models


---
## Research challenges: understand how


<table>
	<tr>
		<td style="height: 21px">&nbsp;… new technologies and services change 
		the behaviour of traffic systems <br><br>… they interact with <strong>
		human traffic participants </strong>and <strong>traffic management</strong><br>
		<br>… we can support cooperative traffic management and urban mobility 
		solutions through appropriate models and methods <br><br>… we can 
		advance towards abstractions and methods for modelling, analysing, 
		predicting, controlling, engineering complex socio- technical systems </td>

## Example: Pedestrian Modelling

Traditional pedestrian models:

*   pedestrians = homogeneous entities (molecules)
*   physical (fluid) dynamics models to describe flows

Social behaviour: repelling forces between molecules e.g. Social forces model <sup>Helbing and Molnar,1995</sup>

* Highly simplified model – can model large problems!
* More complex individual goals and motivations?
* Heterogeneous individual capabilities?

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_012.png#centering)

 
---
## Example: Nagel-Schreckenberg Car Following Model <sup>Nagel and Schreckenberg, 1992</sup>

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_016.gif#floatright)

* Microscopic, discrete model
	* based on cellular automata
	* car behaviour determined by state of preceding car
	
* Use four rules in each step
	1. Increase $v$ by $1$ if possible
	2. Reduce $v$ by $1$ if not enough free cells in front 
	3. Reduce $v$ by $1$ with probability $p$
	4. Drive with new $v$ (all vehicles)

* Simple, homogeneous, not very realistic (but useful)


---
## Modelling socio-technical systems requires a paradigm change

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_018.png#floatright)

*   Heterogeneous actors, different capabilities, preferences, goals
*   Groups <sup>Vizzari et al., 2015</sup>
*   Interaction of human and automated actors
*   Flexible, changing regulatory regimes (rules, norms)

## (Multi-)agent-based modelling and simulation

> _is a (computational) modelling and simulation paradigm that uses the concept of a  multiagent system as the basic metaphor of the simulation model_ <sup>Klügl, 2013</sup>

* Microscopic paradigm
* Abstraction: <u>Agent</u> - fine-granular description of (autonomous) system entities <sup>Jennings et al., 1998</sup>
* Granularity: From cellular to cognitive

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_021.png#centering)


---
## (Multi-)agent-based modelling and simulation

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_022.png#floatright)

*   Abstraction: _Multiagent system_
    > _a (computer) system that is designed and implemented as several interacting agents ... types of interactions including:  cooperation...; coordination...; and negotiation_ <sup>Jennings et al, 1998</sup>



---
## Example: Vehicle agent

*   Perceives the environment via sensors
*   Maintains a model of the state of the environment
*   Has strategic and tactical goals (speed, lane, route choice)
*   Plans and decides how to reach its goals
*   Executes actions that affect the environment
*   Communicates with driver/passenger, cars, infrastructure
*   Reacts to changes in the environment

---
## Key challenges in agent’s research <sup>Wooldridge, 2009</sup>

*   Construct intelligent agents that can carry out actions autonomously on behalf of their users/owners
	* Represent knowledge & semantics of knowledge and action
	* Behave flexibly and adaptively
	* Embedded in environment (sensing & acting)
	
*   Construct multiagent systems, i.e., systems consisting of agents that can interact with other agents to perform the tasks we delegate to them, and to resolve emerging goal conflicts
	* User/agent modelling, personalization</span>
	* Communication, coordination, cooperation, and negotiation</span>
	* Representing and dealing with semantic interoperability</span>


---
## Micro- and macro perspective of Agents/MAS

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_029.png#centering)

    
 
---
## History of intelligent agents

*   1930ies: Cybernetics - mathematical model for analogue control

*   1950ies: Physical symbol systems hypothesis (Simon and Newell)
    The ability to symbolically represent aspects of the world is a prerequisite for intelligent behaviour (use explicit logical reasoning in order to decide what to do) 
    $\rightarrow$ _deliberative agents_
  
*   Since mid 1980s: Problems with symbolic reasoning lead to <u>reactive agents/</u>emergent behaviour (since 1985)

*   Since 1990ies
    *   hybrid/layered architectures reconciling deliberation and reactivity
    *   Focus on social-aware agents, cooperation & negotiation


---
## Agents and dynamic systems

Dynamic systems (control theory) consists of
   *   System (Controller)
   *   Environment

Let
   *   $T$ points in time
   
   *   $S$ possible environmental states
   
   *   $P$ possible inputs (perception) to system
   
   *   $A$ possible output (actions) of system

Let
   * $s(t)$ state of environment at time $t \in T$
   
   * $p(t)$ input to system at time $t \in T$
   
   * $a(t)$ output of system at time $t \in T$

---
## Components of a dynamic system

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_030.png#centering)


---
## Describing the environment

*   The behaviour of the environment in dynamic systems is described by two functions

*   Actions performed by the system modify the state of the environment: $s(t+1) = f(s(t), a(t))$

*   Outputs of the environment (signals) are considered as inputs and result directly from the current state of the environment $s(t): p(t) = g(s(t))$

 
---
## System behaviour: The control problem

*   Task of the system; solving the control problem = Find a sequence of actions to achieve or maintain a desired state of the environment

*   The control problem is often described by two sub-problems:
    *   The _state estimation problem_ determines the current state of the environment from the current input into the system
    
    *   The _regulation problem_ determines an appropriate system response (action) given a recognized state of the environment
    
    *   Functions:
        *   State recognition:  est: $P \rightarrow S$
        *   Regulator: 		    reg: $S \rightarrow A$


---
## Discussion: Agents and dynamic systems

One perspective of agents is that they solve control problems and they can be regarded dynamic systems

But:

* Functions for state estimation and regulation are often incomplete, incorrect, or complex to describe in practical applications

* Functions need to process symbolic knowledge and generate complex, non-numeric output description

* We are looking at distributed systems of loosely coupled agents; control theory does not provide instruments to solve this problem


---
## Discussion: Agents and dynamic systems

Pure control theory models are rarely applicable
*   Failure-prone sensors and actuators (input to est, output of reg)

*   Incomplete, erroneous state model (output of est)

*   System/agent may be in a different state from the one it believes to be in

*   Failure-prone model of effects of actions to environment

But: useful as a basic mathematical model


---
## Minimal abstract agent model (cycle)

<br/><br/>

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_031.png#floatright)

1.  Start in initial state $s$

2.  Observe state of environment and create a perception

3.  Update internal state based on perception

4.  Select next action based on internal state

5.  Execute selected action

6.  Goto step $2$


---
## Deliberative agents

*   Based on principles of symbolic Artificial Intelligence

*   Knowledge based systems with internal and symbolic representation of environment (”mental state”)

*   Decision-making as symbolic reasoning over mental state

*   Idea: Decision-making as theorem proving

*   Not detailed here...


---
## Reactive agents

* Influenced by behaviourist psychology and biology
  *   Simple internal world representation
  *   Tight coupling of perception and action
  *   Simple decision rules
  
*   The complexity of agent behaviour can be a reflection of the complexity of the agent’s environment rather than of the agent’s complex internal design <sup>Simon (1981)</sup>

*   Often: communication via the environment (stigmergy)

*   Model: ant colonies, bee-hives (swarm intelligence)

*   Control architectures: e.g. subsumption architecture by Rodney Brooks


---
## Subsumption architecture <sup>Brooks</sup>
#### Generate intelligent behaviour without explicit representation

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_032.png#centering)
    
    
---
## Control: suppression and inhibition

* $S$: signal from module ($\text{layer}\_k$) suppresses (and replaces) input into module ($\text{layer}\_{k-1}$) for some pre-determined time
* $I$: signal from layer _k_ inhibits output from module (at $\text{layer}\_{k-1}$) for some pre-determined time
* This control is hard-wired

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_035.png#centering)

---
## Example: Ant-based routing <sup>Dorigo et al., 2000</sup>

*   Ants = simple agents that can traverse a graph
*   Ants look for food
*   Ants leave pheromone on the edges they traverse
*   Decision algorithm: Choose the edge with the highest pheromone concentration 
*   Ant-based algorithms have been successfully used to solve routing and scheduling problems
   
![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_038.png#centering)    
    
---
## Practical reasoning

*   Fundamental limitations to the design of deliberative agents
    *   Transforming subsymbolic data in symbolic form is difficult
    *   Decision algorithms undecidable for first-order language
    *   Worst case co-NP-complete for propositional logic
    
*   Alternative approach: Practical reasoning
    *   ”Practical reasoning is a matter of weighing conflicting ”considerations for and against competing options, where the relevant considerations are provided by what the agent <span style=" color: #808089;">desires/values/cares about</span> and what the agent <span style=" color: #808089;">believes”</span> <sup>Bratman, 1990</sup>

*   Combines
    * *Deliberation*: What goals to achieve?
    * *Means-Ends Reasoning*: How to achieve goals?

*   Result of deliberation: *Intentions*


---
## Agents as Belief, Desire, Intention (BDI) systems

*   Belief:
    *   information about the current world state
    *   subjective
    
*   Desire:
    *   preferences over future world states
    *   can be inconsistent (in contrast to goals)
    
*   Intentions:
    *   set of goals the agent is committed to achieve
    *   the agent’s ”runtime stack”
    
*   Formal models:
    *   mostly modal logics with possible-worlds semantics
    *   more pragmatic implementations
    
Underlying theory: Daniel Dennett’s model of intentionality <sup><sup>(Dennett, 1987)



---
## Intentionality: What is an agent?

*   Why would you want to ascribe human-like properties such as beliefs, goals, or intentions to a technical system? (McCarthy)

You always can!
*   ’It is perfectly coherent to treat a light switch as a (very cooperative) agent with the capability of transmitting current at will, who invariably transmits current when it believes that we want it transmitted and not otherwise; flicking the switch is simply our way of communicating our desires’. <sup>Yoav Shoham, 1993</sup>

Yet - Why do we find this absurd?


---
## It’s all about being useful

*   ... because it is not useful for us: we understand the underlying mechanism sufficiently to have a simpler explanation of system behaviour

*   The more we know about a system, the less intentional concepts can help us in describing it

*   The more complex computer systems get, the more we have to rely on abstractions and metaphors to explain their behaviour

*   Considering/modelling a system as an intentional system is such as abstraction and hence a tool to explaining, understanding and (ultimately) programming complex computer systems



---
## Means-Ends Reasoning

*   Means-Ends: ”from means to ends”
    *   Means = ”What can the agent do”
    *   Ends = Goals
    
*   Agent has:
    *   Representation of task to be achieved (intention)
    *   Representation of actions it can perform
    *   Representation of environment

*   Based on this knowledge it attempts to generate/select a plan to achieve the task/satisfy the intention

*   Planning = automated programming: the design of a course of action that will achieve some desired goal

*   Mechanisms for plan generation/selection
    *   Planning from first principles: Automated (AI) planning
    *   Planning from second principles: Select a suitable plan from library


---
## The mother of BDI architectures: IRMA <sup>Bratman et al, 1987</sup>

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_039.gif#centering)


---
## Abstract BDI Agent interpreter <sup>Rao and Georgeff, 1991</sup>

```
initialize-state();
repeat
    options = option-generator(event-queue); 
    selected-options = deliberate(options); 
    update-intentions(selected-options); execute();
    get-new-external-events(); 
    drop-successful-attitudes(); 
    drop-impossible-attitudes();
end repeat
``` 
        
---
## Plattforms for modelling/running BDI agents

*   To realize systems as BDI agent systems, we need
    *   Programming/modelling languages
    *   Runtime execution platforms
    *   Modelling and development tools
    
*   First practically usable implemented BDI system: Procedural Reasoning System PRS <sup>Georgeff and Lansky, 1987</sup>

*   Since then: numerous extensions and re-implementations

*   In this course, we shall investigate as an example:
    *   Programming/modelling language: AgentSpeak
    *   Interpreter/Platform: LightJason


---
## PRS System (Agent) Architecture

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_040.png#centering)



---
## AgentSpeak and LightJason

*   AgentSpeak is a language for defining executable PRS-style BDI agents

*   Paradigm: Logic Programming
    *   Facts are represented by logical formulae
    *   Solve problem/achieve goal $\rightarrow$ Prove formulae via (fuzzy) logical inference

*   LightJason is a scalable implementation of an AgentSpeak interpreter with many useful features and extensions

*   In the simulation lab part of this course, you will get an introduction into LightJason and have a chance to play around with the system by analysing and extending a small traffic scenario model
