## Lecture 3

_MECHANISMS FOR COLLECTIVE DECISION-MAKING_

* Collective decision-making

* Voting mechanisms


---
## Collective decision processes

*   We consider collective decision processes: How can multiple self-interested agents find an agreement on a matter?

*   Different scenarios can be considered:
    *   Agreeing on (fairly) allocating/dividing a shared resource (e.g., auction)
    
    *   _Agreeing on an alternative through voting (e.g., political election)_
    
    *   Agreeing on allocating and solving a common task (who is doing what?)
    
    *   Agreeing on a judgement of opinion (judgment aggregation), e.g. by argumentation

*   Note: We focus on collective decision-making of _automated agents_


---
## Computational Social Choice Theory

*   Social Choice Theory is the study of mechanisms for collective decision making <sup>Arrow et al., 2002</sup>

*   Usually considered part of economic theory, with contributions also from political science, sociology, philosophy, and maths

*   Computational Social Choice: Applies concepts of Social Choice Theory to automated collective decision processes in the field of autonomous agents and multiagent systems. <sup>Brandt et al., 2013</sup>

*   Related to game theory and decision theory


---
## General model: agents, environments, interaction, protocols, mechanisms

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems3/image_003.png#centering)


---
## Mechanism design

*   Interactions between <u>agents</u> are described and enforced by a <u>mechanism</u>

*   The mechanism defines the rules of encounters among agents (e.g. auction, voting, game, or exchange market)

*   <u>Protocols</u> <span class="p">describe how agents interact with each other and with components implementing the mechanism (e.g., an auctioneer)</span>

*   The field of mechanism design investigates how mechanisms should be defined to support certain desirable properties

*   We look at some desirable properties of mechanisms


---
## Properties of mechanisms (and their protocols)

*   __Convergence__: Does the mechanism guarantee successful completion of the interaction?

*   __Maximize social welfare__: Does the mechanism maximize the aggregated utilities of the participating agents?

*   __Pareto efficiency__: Does the mechanism guarantee a solution that no agent can improve for itself without reducing the utility of at least one other agent?

*   __Individual rationality__: Is it the rational choice of all agents to follow the rules given by the mechanism?</span>

*   __Stability__: Does the mechanisms provide all agents an incentive to behave in a certain (desirable) manner (e.g. Nash equilibrium)?</span>


---
## More properties of mechanisms

*   __Simplicity:__ Does the mechanism make it easy for agents to find an optimal (or appropriate) strategy?

*   __Efficiency of communication:__ Does the mechanism support finding a solution with low communication effort?

*   __Robustness:__ Is the mechanism tolerant with respect to the failure of individual agents? (e.g., no "single point of failure")

*   __Symmetry, fairness:__ Does the protocol treat all participants equally or does it intrinsically favour certain agents?


---
## Collective decision-making through voting

* Voting is an often used class of mechanisms for collective decision-making

* Individual agents of a group have differing preferences over possible outcomes

* A central instance knows these preferences, or agents reveal their preferences truthfully (assumption!)

* A __social choice function__ aggregates the preferences and makes a decision

* This decision is considered binding for/by all agents of the group


---
## Social choice rule vs. Social choice function

$Ag={1,...,n}$ set of agents $\Omega = { \omega , \omega ' , ... }$
possible outcomes Preference ordering for each voter $i$ e.g. $\omega_2 \succ  \omega_1 \succ  \omega_3$ <sup>Adapted from (Wooldridge, 2009, p. 285)</sup>

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems3/image_004.png#centering)


---
## Selected voting procedures

*   Plurality voting

*   Sequential majority elections, aka Binary voting

    *   Outcomes ''play'' tournament of pairwise comparisons

*   Borda count voting

*   __Slater ranking__


---
## Plurality voting

*   Every voter submits preference order

*   We count how many times each outcome is ranked first

*   Winner is the outcome with the highest count

*   For two outcomes: majority voting!

*   Advantages:
    *   Easy to implement
    *   Easy to understand for voters

*   Anomalous properties can be observed when more than two candidates


---
## Plurality voting: Political elections example

*   Consider elections with three parties $c(du)$, $s(pd)$, and $f(dp)$ Candidates $\omega_c, \omega_s, \omega_f$
*   We consider three voter groups with similar preferences:

* Conventionally left-wing (38%): $\omega_s \succ  \omega_f \succ  \omega_c$

* Social liberal (18%): $\omega_f \succ  \omega_s \succ  \omega_c$

* Conservative right-wing (44%): $\omega_c \succ  \omega_f \succ  \omega_s$


*   Plurality voting: CDU wins

But: For 56% of the voters, $ \omega_c$ was the least preferred candidate

*   Consequence:
	*   FDP voters are likely to vote for SPD candidate
    *   Strategically misrepresent preferences in order to bring about a more preferred outcome


---
## Plurality voting: Condorcet paradox

* Suppose you have three candidates $\omega_1, \omega_2, \omega_3$ and three voters, $Ag = {1,2,3}$ with preferences
    * $\omega_1 \succ_1  \omega_2 \succ_1  \omega_3$
    * $\omega_3 \succ_2  \omega_1 \succ_2  \omega_2$
    * $\omega_2 \succ_3  \omega_3 \succ_3  \omega_1$

*   Observations for plurality voting
    *   outcome is tied - no winner
    *   Suppose, we select: $\omega_1: \frac{2}{3}$ of the voters would prefer $\omega_3 \ over \ \omega_1$!

*   Suppose, we select: $ \omega_3: \ \frac{2}{3}$ of the voters would prefer $\omega_2 \ over \ \omega_1$!

*   Suppose, we select: $ \omega_2: \ \frac{2}{3}$ of the voters would prefer $ \omega_1 \ over \ \omega_2$!

*   For every outcome, there is another candidate that is preferred by at least $\frac{2}{3}$ of the candidates!

*   Paradox of the cyclic majorities


---
## Possible winner vs. Condorcet winner

*   An outcome is a _possible winner_ if there is some voting agenda which could result in that outcome being a winner

*   An outcome is called the _Condorcet winner_ if it is the overall winner for each agenda, i.e. if it would win a two-candidate election against each of the other outcomes in a plurality vote

*   Finding possible winners and Condorcet winner (if existent) are two important computational problems in Computational Social Choice theory

*   To solve them, we introduce the concept of a majority graph as a compact representation of preference structures


---
## Analysing preference structures: majority graph

* Directed graph
    * Nodes correspond to outcomes $ \omega \in \Omega$
    * Edge from outcome $\omega$ to $\omega'$
    * if a majority of voters rank (in a direct competition) $\omega$ above $\omega'$
    * Properties of majority graph 

*   Complete: 
    * For any two outcomes $\omega_i$ and $\omega_j$
    * either $\omega_i$ defeats $\omega_j$
    * or $\omega_j$ defeats $\omega_i$

*   Asymmetric: 
    * if $\omega_i$ defeats $\omega_j$
    * $\omega_j$ must not defeat $\omega_i$
    * Irreflexive: An outcome will never defeat itself
    * A graph with these properties is called "tournament"

---
## Majority graph: Usage and Examples

* A candidate $\omega_i$ is a possible winner, if for every other outcome $\omega_j$ there is an path from $\omega_i$ to $\omega_j$

* A candidate $\omega_i$ is a Condorcet winner, if there is an edge $\omega_i$  to every other edge in the graph
    *   Left: Every outcome is a possible winner
    *   Right: Outcome $\omega_1$ is a Condorcet winner

---
## Binary voting

*   Alternatives "play" against each other bilaterally in a K.O. tournament

*   The social choice function provides the tournament schedule and records the results makes the decision

*   The binary voting protocol has a number of disadvantages as the following example shows


---
## The schedule paradox

*   Let $x$, $y$, $z$ be possible outcomes of the voting

*   Let the group of agents be divided in three subgroups
    * Group 1: $x > z > y$ (35% of overall group size)
    * Group 2: $y > x > z$ (33%)
    * Group 3: $z > y > x$  (32%)

*   Consider the following three variants of the tournament schedule, the result depends on how the schedule is designed

| _a_                                                   | _b_                                                   | _c_                                                   |

---
## In the binary protocol, irrelevant alternatives may cause problems

* Assumption: Alternative $z$ is irrelevant for the decision

* By adding $z$ as an alternative, the outcome may change

* Consider cases b) and c) in the example on the previous slide

* $Z$ is irrelevant, because it wins in neither of the two cases

* But: If $z$ first plays against $x \rightarrow y$ wins, if $z$ first plays against $y \rightarrow x$ wins


---
## The pareto-dominated winner paradox

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems3/image_011.png#floatright)

* Let $a$, $b$, $x$, $y$ be possible outcomes

* Let the group of agents be divided into three (equally sized) subgroups:
    * Group 1: $x > y > b > a$
    * Group 2: $a > x > y > b$
    * Group 3: $b > a > x > y$
 
* $y$ wins even though everyone prefers $x$ to $y$


---
## Borda Voting

* The Borda mechanism attempts to resolve the problems observed for binary voting

* Let $x_1, ..., x_n$ be the possible outcomes, then each agent scores its most-preferred outcomes $n$ points, its second- most preferred outcome $n-1$ points, etc., and its least preferred outcome $1$ point.

* The sum of scores is calculated for all outcomes / agents

* The outcome with the highest aggregated score wins

Example above:

 * $X$ receives score of $3 \cdot 0.35 + 2 \cdot 0.33 + 1 \cdot 0.32 = 2.03$
 * $Y$ receives score of $1.98$ 
 * $Z$ receives score of $1.99$ $\rightarrow$ _**Using Borda Voting, x wins**_


---
## Reversed-order paradox

*   Let $a, b, c, x$ be possible outcomes
*   Let the agents be divided into the following (equally sized) groups:
    *   Group 1 & 4: $x > c > b > a$
    *   Group 2 & 5: $a > x > c > b$
    *   Group 3 & 6: $b > a > x > c$ 
    *   Group 7: $x > c > b > a$
    
*   Borda values are: $x=22$, $a=17$, $b=16$, $c=15$ 

*   If we remove outcome $x$, we get: $c=15$, $b=14$, $a=13$ , as $c$ is always behind $x$, it doesn't lose points by removal of $x$ 


---
## Borda Voting is also sensitive to irrelevant alternatives

*   Let $x, y, z$ be possible outcomes

*   Three groups of agents
    * Group  1: $x > z > y$ (35%)
    * Group  2: $y > x > z$ (33%)
    * Group  3: $z > y > x$ (32%)

*   As described before, the winner using Borda Voting is $x$, i.e. $z$ can be considered an irrelevant alternative

*   By removing $z$ from the voting, $y$ becomes the winner


---
## The majority winner's paradox

*  In some cases, Borda Voting violates the principle of the majority winner

*  Example: Consider seven groups of agents:
    *  Group 1-3: $a > b > c$
    *  Group 4-5: $b > c > a$ 
    *  Group 6: $b > a > c$
    *  Group 7: $c > a > b$

*  Winner according to the majority rule for every binary protocol: **_a_**

*  Borda values: $b=16$, $a=15$, $c=11$ 


---
## Is there a desirable way of aggregating preferences of multiple agents?

* Let $\Omega$ be a set of outcomes and let $A$ be a set of agents
* Each agent $\in A$ has a (total) preference ordering $R_i$ over $\Omega$

* Let $R = \left(R\_i, ..., R\_{\vert A \vert}\right)$
* Let $G(R,\Omega)$ be the social choice function


---
## Desiderata for $G$

#### 1.

* $G$ should: _**satisfy the Pareto principle**_

* if each agent prefers $x$ over $y$, then $G(R, \Omega)$ also prefers $x$ over $y$


#### 2.
* G should: **_be independent of irrelevant alternatives:_**

* if $G(R,\Omega)$ prefers $x$ over $y$ __and__ $R$ is another preference profile such that the preference value between $x$ and $y$ is the same in $R'$ as in $R$ for each agent 

* **then** $G(R',  \Omega)$ also prefers $x$ over $y$


#### 3.
* $G$ should: _**be non-dictatorial**_

* No single agent in $A$ determines the preferences for every pair $x,y  \in \Omega$


---
## Arrow's impossibility theorem (in a nutshell)

For $\vert \Omega \vert \geq 3$, there exists no social choice function $G$ that satisfies all desiderata 1-3

*   Implication: every social choice function that satisfies 1. and 2. is dictatorial

*   What can we do? Which property can we do compromise on more easily? 1. or 2.?

*   Other option: Change how voters express preferences
    *   Range Voting: candidates are rated on a scale, e.g. $0 ... 100$
    
    *   Approval voting: binary rating; $1$ = acceptable, $0$ = not acceptable


---

## A (Near?) Future Scenario: Ridesharing with PATs

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems3/image_013.jpg#floatright)

*   2030: _Personalized Autonomous Transportation_ Cells (PATs)

*   Modular 1-PATs can connect automatically to form N-PATs

*   Travellers provide preference information to PAT via App

*   CITY X pilots N-PAT based system replace CITY X pilots public transport in city centre:
    *   1-PATs are provided for hire
    *   N-PATs choose route based on passengers' preferences
        
*   CITY X traffic authority
    *   forbids 1-PATs to enter the town centre
    *   allows entry for 4-PATs or larger platoons

## Ridesharing Scenario: Scheduling city group tour <sup>Dennisen and Müller, ATT 2016</sup>

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems3/image_071.png#floatright)

*   Travellers in 1-PATs join into N-PATs

*   Different preferences on POIs to visit

*   Committee elections within N-PATs: which POIs to visit?

*   Iterative algorithm, allows dissatisfied voters to leave


---
## Analysis of scenario - Research questions

*   _How can 1-PATs form into N-PAT in a way that assigns travellers with similar preferences to the same N-PAT?_

*   _How can travellers that are not satisfied with the route or that changed their opinion/preferences, be enabled to leave an N-PAT and join another?_

*   _Is there an optimal N-PAT size for certain sets of POIs ...? And with respect to which criteria?_

*   The scenario rests on the hypothesis that traffic efficiency, pedestrian comfort, and traffic safety can be increased by such technology. _Is this true?_

## Results: Voting architecture and simulation testbed <sup>Dennisen & Müller, MATES 2015</sup>

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems3/image_072.jpg#floatright)

*   Requirements for traffic voting identified

*   Formal model and voting architecture
    
*   J-VOTING evaluation testbed based on <sup>Grimaldo et al, 2012</sup>


---
## Results: Iterative committee elections in a ride-sharing application <sup>Dennisen and Mueller, ATT 2016</sup>

*   Propose iterative winner determination protocol
    *   allows dissatisfied voters to leave
    *   guarantees that remaining voters are satisfied

*   Experimental evaluation
    *   How do different committee voting rules under an iterative protocol compare regarding the number of iterations required?

*   Voting rules considered
    *   Minisum Approval: Utilitarian approach - minimise sum of dissatisfaction values
    *   Minimax Approval: Egalitarian approach - minimise maximal dissatisfaction

$\rightarrow$ **_Results depend heavily on input parameters_** **dissatisfaction threshold** **_and_** **committee size**


---
## Voting in traffic applications: Many challenges remain!

*   Combinatorial voting: Voting on large numbers of alternatives

*   Voting in operation-level situations: Needs both, theoretical and practical work on time-constrained voting (e.g. anytime properties, upper bounds on runtimes)
    *   Scalability influenced by winner determination, communication protocols, application parameters, runtime platform, ...

*   **_How can preference information be elicited and securely managed?_**


---
## Summary

*   Computational Social Choice Theory offers a rich set of tools for modelling/implementing collective decisions

*   There is no perfect mechanism: what works well, depends on the application characteristics

*   The way preferences (votes) are formulated has a great impact

*   There are similarities between game theory, computational social choice theory, decision theory, and auctions

*   All rely on the notions of agents, protocols, and mechanisms (environments)

*   All require mechanism design
